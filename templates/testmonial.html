                <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
                <h3 style="font-style:normal; color: blue; text-decoration: underline">Shekar: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am competent at python programming and fundamentals and am slowly becoming an expert.
                        I am now becoming good on using lists, functions and dictionaries to efficiently carry out procedures,
                        and I can now implement these python skills into a project </li>
                    <li>I am close to becoming an expert with CSS styling and data implementation. By using either in-line
                        css, or in-file css, I am able to further the HTML page by adding both major and minor details</li>
                    <li>I am competent in using html code and designing a front end for a website. This is what allowed
                        me to combine many files and all the CSS to create an engaging and efficient home page and website</li>
                    <li>I can build a web server using python and flask with app routes. I can do this to combine
                        many html, js, and python files in one project </li>
                    <li>I am now learning concepts of data, and applying data to solve algorithms. I am currently
                        trying to use data from one application of our project for another application of our project,
                        and making equations and algorithms to achieve it</li>
                    <li>Compsci has helped me become a better team worker since I realized that you don't have to be a master
                        at all parts of coding. After talking and coding with my teammates, I understand their strengths
                        and weaknesses, and I can rely on them to complete a part of the project. The trust that is built
                        helps the project gets done, as each member works on a different aspect of the project. I have realized
                        this through the projects my team has coded and I am confident that as better team workers, we
                        can get much more done </li>
                </ul>

The input put in is a program downloadable onto the desktop of the local host computer that will store the user imputed data such as their login username and password onto the program.<li>
                    <li>Another list that will represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage a program complexity is the leaderboard system that is being made in our project. The leaderboard will be able to collect data and store it from the program's purpose.<li>
                    <li>A procedure that contributes to the program's intended purpose is the blackjack game which can use data to execute the game and return in back to the player.<li>
